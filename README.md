# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation is to chase and find my lifes purpose and to create something that helps people of all kind that are in need. I created the Prework Study Guide for the Coding Bootcamp to refer to while taking the course. The study guide contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It makes the information I have learned throughout the prework more organized and accessible. I have learend a ton about the basics of coding and the mindset it requires.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
